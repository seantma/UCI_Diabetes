## Note
This repository contains the analysis of the UCI Diabetes dataset in a Jupyter notebook format `UCI_Diabetes.ipynb`. Original dataset is included to help facilitate the analysis. 

All used packages for analysis (and their versions) are captured in the `Docker/Dockerfile` document. The `Docker/DockerCommands.md` contains instructions on how to reproduce the analysis, including how to **build & run** the `Docker` container. 

This container also includes a working `Jupyter` notebook server and can be accessed to open the notebook by pointing your browser to http://127.0.0.1:10000 once the `Docker` container is running.
